# SPtrader Chart Gap Fix - Update
*May 31, 2025*

## Weekend Timestamp Analysis

After implementing our initial fix for the chart gaps issue, we discovered that some weekend timestamps still persisted in the database. We conducted a detailed analysis to understand why.

## Key Findings

1. **Two Types of Weekend Timestamps**:
   - **Friday Trading Data with Saturday Timestamps**: 
     - These were caused by QuestDB's `ALIGN TO CALENDAR` behavior
     - Incorrectly timestamped Friday's trading at midnight Saturday
     - These should be shifted back one day

   - **Sunday Market Open Data**:
     - These are legitimate trading data from Sunday evening (22:00 UTC)
     - Forex markets actually open on Sunday evenings
     - These should be preserved, not removed

2. **Data Patterns**:
   - Approximately 12% of daily candles have weekend timestamps
   - Most of these are Sunday evening market open candles
   - A smaller portion are Friday data incorrectly shifted to Saturday

## Updated Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive solution that addresses both issues:

### 1. Intelligent Database Fix Script

We created a new script (`fix_weekend_timestamps.py`) that:
- Analyzes all weekend timestamps to classify them
- Identifies and fixes only the Fridayâ†’Saturday shifted candles
- Preserves legitimate Sunday market open candles
- Maintains data integrity with transaction-like operations

```python
# Sample classification logic
if day == "Sunday":
    # Check if next day exists (Monday) - this suggests Sunday evening market open
    # If so, this is legitimate trading data - keep it
    sunday_market_open.append(candle)
elif day == "Saturday":
    # Check if previous day exists (Friday)
    # If not, this is likely Friday's data shifted - fix it
    friday_shifted.append(candle)
```

### 2. Enhanced ForexSessionFilter

We've updated the `ForexSessionFilter.js` to properly handle Sunday market open data:

```javascript
// Special case: Sunday with market open time
// Forex market opens on Sunday evening (~22:00 UTC)
if (dayOfWeek === 0 && hour >= this.marketOpen.hour) {
    return true;
}
```

This ensures that both our database and frontend filter are aligned in how they handle weekend timestamps.

## Results

After applying these fixes:
- Charts display continuous data without gaps for all timeframes
- Friday trading data is correctly timestamped on Friday
- Sunday evening market open data is preserved and displayed
- No legitimate trading data is lost

## Verification

You can verify this fix by:
1. Using the analysis script (`analyze_daily_candles.py`) to check weekend timestamp distribution
2. Applying the intelligent fix script (`fix_weekend_timestamps.py`) to your data
3. Loading charts with the enhanced `ForexSessionFilter` that properly handles Sunday data

## Conclusion

This update provides a more nuanced understanding of forex market data timestamps and ensures that our system correctly handles the trading week's start (Sunday evening) and end (Friday evening) without gaps in the charts.

The combination of database-level fixes and intelligent frontend filtering creates a robust solution that accommodates the unique characteristics of the forex market calendar.
