### Critical Bug Fix: Historical Data Display ✅ (May 31, 2025)
1. **Fixed Data Trimming Issue in Charts**
   - ✅ Identified critical bug in VirtualDataManager that limited chart to showing only recent data
   - ✅ Fixed window size limitation (increased from 2,000 to 2,000,000 candles)
   - ✅ Modified `applyWindow()` function to never trim historical data
   - ✅ Added warning comments to prevent regression
   - ✅ Created VIRTUAL_DATA_IMPORTANT.md with detailed explanation

### Lazy Loading Data Management ✅ (23:05 UTC)
1. **On-Demand Data Fetching**
   - ✅ Implemented DataManager service (`internal/services/data_manager.go`)
   - ✅ Created lazy loading API endpoints (`internal/api/data_handlers.go`)
   - ✅ Smart data availability checking with gap detection
   - ✅ Background data fetching with ILP integration
   - ✅ Prevents duplicate fetches with mutex locks

2. **New API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/v1/data/check` - Check data availability for symbol/range
   - `POST /api/v1/data/ensure` - Trigger background data fetch
   - `GET /api/v1/data/status` - Overall data status monitoring
   - `GET /api/v1/candles/lazy` - Smart candles with auto-fetch

### ILP Data Ingestion Implementation ✅ (20:50 UTC)
1. **High-Performance Data Loading**
   - ✅ Implemented ILP (InfluxDB Line Protocol) over TCP
   - ✅ Created Go ingestion service at `/cmd/ingestion/main.go`
   - ✅ QuestDB ILP on port 9009 (vs HTTP on 9000)
   - ✅ Successfully loaded 74,575 ticks in 2 seconds!

2. **Data Loading Results**
   - Total ticks in database: 39,519,525
   - OHLC candles generated: 585,940 (1-minute bars)
   - Date range: March 1, 2023 - May 30, 2025
   - Performance: ~37,000 ticks/second via ILP

3. **Python-Go Bridge**
   - Created `dukascopy_to_ilp.py` for seamless data loading
   - Downloads from Dukascopy → Processes → Pipes to Go ILP service
   - Solved HTTP query size limitations (was failing with 3,761 records)

### Major Architecture Decision: Migrating to Go ✅
1. **Successfully Running Go API**
   - ✅ Go 1.23.9 installed
   - ✅ Built and running on port 8080
   - ✅ Connected to QuestDB (needed `?sslmode=disable`)

## ✅ Testing Complete (May 25, 2025 20:45 UTC)

### 1. **API Endpoints** ✅
```bash
# Health check - WORKING
sptrader api health
# Returns: {"service":"sptrader-api","status":"healthy","uptime":"2m14s","version":"1.0.0"}

# Candle data - WORKING
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/candles?symbol=EURUSD&tf=1h&start=2024-01-19T10:00:00Z&end=2024-01-19T16:00:00Z"
# Returns: 60 candles with proper OHLC data

# Test viewport optimization (different date ranges)
# Should use different tables based on range
```

### 2. **Data Loading** ✅
```bash
# ILP loading (NEW METHOD - RECOMMENDED)
cd ~/SPtrader/data_feeds
python3 dukascopy_to_ilp.py EURUSD 2024-01-22 2024-01-23
# Result: Loaded 74,575 ticks in 2 seconds via ILP!

# Verify data
sptrader db query "SELECT count(*) FROM market_data_v2"
# Result: 78,175 records
```

### 3. **OHLC Generation** ✅
```bash
# Generate 1-minute candles from tick data
cd ~/SPtrader/scripts
python3 simple_ohlc_generator.py EURUSD

# Verify OHLC data
sptrader db query "SELECT count(*) FROM ohlc_1m_v2 WHERE symbol='EURUSD'"
# Result: 585,940 one-minute candles covering Mar 2023 - May 2025
```

### 4. **Cache Performance**
```bash
# Make repeated API calls and check cache hit rate
sptrader api stats
# Should see hit_rate increase after warm-up
```

### OHLC Candle Generation Improvement ✅ (May 31, 2025)
1. **Rebuilt All Timeframe Candles**
   - ✅ Created new `simple_ohlc_generator.py` script for reliable candle generation
   - ✅ Generated 1-minute candles directly from all tick data
   - ✅ Built all higher timeframes (5m→15m→30m→1h→4h→1d)
   - ✅ Fixed issues with QuestDB's SAMPLE BY aggregation
   - ✅ Generated 585,940 one-minute candles (full date range)
   - ✅ Added `OHLC_GENERATION_README.md` documentation

## 🚧 What's Not Implemented Yet

### 1. **Frontend** 
- ❌ React application (structure created, not implemented)
- ❌ Lightweight-charts integration  
- ❌ Lazy loading frontend integration
- ❌ WebSocket for real-time updates
- ❌ Symbol and timeframe selectors

### 2. **Advanced Features**
- ❌ User authentication
- ❌ Trading strategy backtesting
- ❌ Alerts and notifications
- ❌ Multi-user support

### 3. **Production Hardening**
- ❌ SSL/TLS certificates
- ❌ Rate limiting
- ❌ Comprehensive error handling
- ❌ Deployment configuration (Docker/systemd)

## 📋 Next Steps - Data-First Approach (Updated May 25, 2025)

### 1. **Profile Data Performance** (Priority: CRITICAL)
```bash
# Start with small test data
sptrader start
cd ~/SPtrader/data_feeds
python dukascopy_importer.py  # Load 1 week EURUSD only

# Profile the data limits
cd ~/SPtrader/tools
python profile_data_limits.py

# This generates:
# - data_contract.json (performance boundaries)
# - data_contract.ts (TypeScript interface)
```

### 2. **Enhance API Based on Profiling**
Based on profiling results, enhance the FastAPI backend:
- Add smart resolution selection
- Implement viewport-aware queries
- Add query explanation endpoint
- Return metadata with responses

Consider Go service if Python performance insufficient.

### 3. **Implement Data-Aware Frontend**
Using the data contract:
```javascript
// Frontend respects backend limits
import { DATA_CONTRACT } from './data_contract';

class ChartDataManager {
  constructor() {
    this.contract = DATA_CONTRACT;
  }
  
  selectResolution(timeRange) {
    // Use contract to pick optimal resolution
  }
}
```

### 4. **Test with Increasing Data Volumes**
Gradually scale up:
- 1 week → 1 month → 1 year
- 1 pair → 5 pairs → all pairs
- Monitor performance degradation
- Adjust contracts as needed

### 5. **Production Deployment**
Only after performance is proven:
- Set up systemd services
- Configure nginx reverse proxy
- Add SSL certificates
- Set up monitoring

## 🎮 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Daily Operations
sptrader start          # Start everything
sptrader monitor        # Watch real-time status
sptrader logs -f        # Follow all logs

# Data Management
sptrader db stats       # Check data counts
sptrader optimize       # Run viewport optimizations

# Troubleshooting
sptrader status         # Check what's running
sptrader api health     # Test API
sptrader stop           # Stop everything
```

## 📊 Current Architecture

```
Data Flow:
Oanda/Dukascopy → QuestDB → Go API → React
                     ↓
              Viewport Tables
              (Optimized queries)

Ports:
- QuestDB: 9000
- Go API: 8080  
- React: 5173 (when implemented)
```

## 💡 Tips for Development

1. **Always check logs** when something fails:
   ```bash
   sptrader logs -f
   ```

2. **Monitor cache performance** to ensure speed:
   ```bash
   watch -n 5 'curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/stats | jq .cache'
   ```

3. **Use the CLI** for everything - it handles proper startup order

4. **Test with different viewports** to ensure optimization works:
   - 1 day = detailed data
   - 1 month = hourly aggregates
   - 1 year = daily aggregates

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Frontend package.json is empty** - Needs proper React setup
2. **No authentication** - API is completely open
3. **No data persistence config** - QuestDB data location not specified
4. **Oanda feed failing** - market_data table missing data_source column (fix identified)
5. **SPtrader-login.py terminal closing** - Need to decide on post-auth behavior

## 📈 Performance Targets

- API response time: < 100ms (cached), < 500ms (database)
- Cache hit rate: > 50% after warm-up
- Concurrent requests: 100+
- Memory usage: < 500MB total
