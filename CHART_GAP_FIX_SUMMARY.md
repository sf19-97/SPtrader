# SPtrader Chart Gap Fix - Summary
*May 31, 2025*

## Issue Fixed

We've successfully fixed the chart gaps issue in the SPtrader desktop application. The charts now display continuous data without weekend gaps for all timeframes.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a combination of:

1. **QuestDB's `SAMPLE BY 1d ALIGN TO CALENDAR` behavior**:
   - Daily candles were timestamped at midnight UTC of the next day
   - Friday's trading data received Saturday timestamps

2. **ForexSessionFilter filtering behavior**:
   - The filter correctly removed weekend timestamps
   - But this also removed Friday trading data (with Saturday timestamps)

## Our Solution

We implemented a multi-faceted solution that addresses the issue at different levels:

### 1. Fixed Daily Candle Generation

We created a script (`fixed_ohlc_generator_timestamp_fix.py`) that regenerates daily candles with corrected timestamps:

```sql
-- Shift timestamp back one day to fix QuestDB's ALIGN TO CALENDAR behavior
INSERT INTO ohlc_1d_v2_new
SELECT 
    timestamp::timestamp - 86400000000 as timestamp,
    symbol,
    ...
```

### 2. Enhanced ForexSessionFilter

We updated the ForexSessionFilter to handle daily candles intelligently:

- Added special handling with the `isWeekday()` method
- For daily candles: Preserves Monday-Friday data regardless of timestamp
- For intraday candles: Continues to use `isMarketOpen()` to check precise market hours

### 3. Updated Renderer Integration

Modified the renderer.js to pass the timeframe information to the filter:

```javascript
const timeframe = document.getElementById('timeframe').value;
const continuousData = forexSessionFilter.createContinuousView(chartData, timeframe);
```

## Verification

We've verified the fix using:

1. Manual testing of the chart display
2. Automated verification script (`verify_chart_gaps_fix.py`)
3. Specific testing of the March 2023 data that originally showed the issue

## Documentation

Detailed documentation has been added:

- `docs/CHART_GAPS_FIX.md`: Complete technical documentation of the issue and fix
- `scripts/verify_chart_gaps_fix.py`: Verification script
- `scripts/fixed_ohlc_generator_timestamp_fix.py`: Script for regenerating daily candles

## Future Considerations

For a more comprehensive solution, consider:

1. Modifying QuestDB queries to align daily candles to 22:00 UTC (forex market close)
2. Adding tests to verify timestamp alignment across all timeframes
3. Implementing monitoring for timestamp issues in the data pipeline

## Status: âœ… FIXED

The chart gaps issue has been resolved. Users should now see continuous charts with proper display of trading days and without weekend gaps.
