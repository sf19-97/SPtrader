- Git branch indicator (if in git repo)

**Main Control Panel (Top Section):**
- Organized in 5 columns of clickable buttons:
  - Services
  - API
  - Database
  - Logs
  - DevOps (NEW)

**Live Monitoring Panel (Middle Section):**
- Real-time service status with memory usage
- Updates every 5 seconds
- Color coding: Green=running, Red=stopped, Yellow=warning

**Information Panel (Bottom Section):**
- Shows output from commands
- Scrollable text area
- Clear button to reset

**Status Bar (Footer):**
- Show last action performed
- Keyboard shortcuts reminder
- Connection status indicators

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running test suite..."
python -m pytest --cov=api --cov=scripts --cov-report=term-missing
```

**deploy.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Deployment pipeline starting..."
./run_tests.sh || exit 1
./migrations/migrate.py || exit 1
./stop_all.sh
./start_background.sh
./tools/test_connectivity.sh || exit 1
echo "Deployment complete!"
```

**quality_check.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running quality checks..."
black --check .
flake8 .
mypy api/
```

## 7. Configuration File

Create `.sptrader_tui.yaml`:
```yaml
ci_cd:
  auto_test_on_save: true
  deployment_branch: main
  rollback_limit: 5
  test_timeout: 300

quality:
  black_line_length: 88
  flake8_max_complexity: 10
  mypy_strict: true

monitoring:
  refresh_interval: 5
  log_buffer_size: 1000

```

## 8. Visual Design Requirements

### DevOps Section Colors:
- Git status: Yellow for uncommitted, Green for clean
- Tests: Green=passed, Red=failed, Yellow=running
- Deploy button: Blue, but Red if tests failing
- Quality indicators: Traffic light colors

### Unicode Characters to Use:
- ‚úÖ for running services
- ‚ùå for stopped services
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  for warnings
- üîÑ for refresh/restart
- üìä for stats
- üöÄ for start
- üõë for stop

## 10. Example CI/CD Workflow in TUI

1. User makes code changes
2. TUI detects uncommitted changes (yellow indicator)
3. User clicks "Run Tests" button
4. TUI shows test progress in real-time
5. If tests pass, "Deploy" button becomes active
6. User clicks "Deploy" with confirmation
7. TUI runs deployment pipeline with progress
8. Success/failure notification
9. Option to rollback if needed

## Additional Specifications

### Script Execution Standards

**Output Handling:**
- All script outputs should be captured and displayed in the TUI's output panel
- Preserve ANSI color codes from bash scripts (your scripts use color)
- Show real-time output for long-running commands (don't wait for completion)
- Scripts that output JSON should be parsed and formatted nicely

**Error Handling:**
- Check exit codes from all script executions
- If a script fails (non-zero exit), show error in red
- Common errors to handle gracefully:
  - QuestDB not running when trying to query
  - API not responding on port 8000
  - Permission denied errors

### State Management

**Don't Cache Status:**
- Always call check scripts for current state
- Don't assume a service is still running from last check
- Refresh status before any action (e.g., check if services are running before "restart")

**Background Updates:**
- Status checks should run in background threads
- UI should never freeze during script execution
- Show spinner/loading indicator during operations

### Script Dependencies

**Required Shell Commands:**
The TUI should verify these are available on startup:
- `curl` - Used for API calls
- `pgrep` - Used for process checking
- `netstat` or `ss` - Used for port checking
- `python3` - Used for various scripts

**Environment Variables:**
- Respect `SPTRADER_HOME` if set, otherwise use `/home/millet_frazier/SPtrader`
- Pass through user's PATH for script execution

### Special Behaviors to Preserve

**Start Services Sequence:**
- `start_background.sh` has built-in delays and health checks
- Show its output in real-time so user sees the startup sequence
- Don't timeout too quickly - QuestDB can take 10+ seconds

**Log Following:**
- When showing logs, allow user to filter by service
- Highlight ERROR and WARNING lines
- Allow user to stop following with ESC or 'q'

**Database Queries:**
- Queries go to `http://localhost:9000/exec`
- Results come back as JSON with dataset array
- Empty results are not an error

### Configuration & Persistence

**Settings to Remember** (store in `~/.sptrader_tui.conf`):
- Last window size
- Preferred refresh interval (default 5 seconds)
- Whether to auto-start services on TUI launch
- Custom keybindings

**Don't Persist:**
- Service status
- API statistics  
- Log content

### Integration Points

**With SPtrader-login.py:**
- The TUI should accept a `--skip-start` flag
- If not provided, auto-run start_background.sh on launch
- This lets the auth wrapper control startup behavior

**With existing monitor.sh:**
- The TUI replaces monitor.sh functionality
- But monitor.sh should still work independently
- Consider adding "Launch Old Monitor" option in TUI

### Failure Modes

**If TUI Can't Start:**
- Fall back to launching regular `sptrader` CLI
- Show clear error message about what failed
- Don't leave user with nothing

**If All Services Down:**
- TUI should still function
- Clearly indicate what's not working
- Offer easy "Start All Services" option

### Performance Considerations

**Resource Usage:**
- TUI should use < 50MB RAM
- CPU usage < 5% when idle
- Don't query status more than once per second

**Log Handling:**
- When reading logs, use `tail` not reading entire file
- Limit log display to last 1000 lines
- Implement log rotation awareness

### Security Notes

**Command Injection:**
- Never pass user input directly to shell commands
- Sanitize SQL queries before sending to QuestDB
- Use subprocess with arrays, not shell=True

**File Access:**
- Only read/execute files within SPTRADER_HOME
- Don't allow arbitrary file browsing

### Testing Requirements

The TUI should be tested with:
- All services running normally
- Some services down
- No services running
- QuestDB returning errors
- Slow network conditions
- Terminal resize during operation
- Both mouse and keyboard-only navigation

### Documentation to Include

Create these files in the tui/ directory:
- `README.md` - How to use the TUI
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - How it's built
- `KEYBINDINGS.md` - All keyboard shortcuts
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues

### Exit Behavior

When user quits TUI:
- Ask "Stop all services?" (Yes/No/Cancel)
- If No: Just exit TUI, leave services running
- If Yes: Run stop_all.sh then exit
- If Cancel: Return to TUI

This ensures users don't accidentally leave services running.

## Summary

This enhanced TUI provides a complete development and operations center, combining monitoring with CI/CD capabilities for true institutional-grade efficiency. It maintains the modular architecture by delegating to existing scripts rather than reimplementing functionality.
