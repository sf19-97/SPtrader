# SPtrader Session Changelog

## Session: May 25, 2025 23:07 UTC

### 1. Lazy Loading System Implementation ✅
**What Changed:**
- Implemented DataManager service (`internal/services/data_manager.go`)
- Created lazy loading API handlers (`internal/api/data_handlers.go`)
- Added 4 new API endpoints for on-demand data fetching
- Integrated with existing ILP data loading infrastructure

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/data/check` - Check data availability for symbol/range
- `POST /api/v1/data/ensure` - Trigger background data fetch
- `GET /api/v1/data/status` - Overall data status monitoring  
- `GET /api/v1/candles/lazy` - Smart candles with auto-fetch

**How It Works:**
1. Frontend requests data via `/candles/lazy`
2. API checks QuestDB for data gaps using hourly analysis
3. If missing: Background fetch from Dukascopy via ILP
4. If available: Return immediately with full candles
5. Prevents duplicate fetches with mutex locks

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/internal/services/data_manager.go` - Core lazy loading service
- `/internal/api/data_handlers.go` - New API endpoints
- `/cmd/api/main.go` - Route integration
- `/lazy_loading_demo_working.py` - Demo script
- `/examples/lazy_loading_demo.py` - Usage examples

**Benefits:**
- No more manual data loading - happens automatically
- Frontend can request any date range confidently
- Existing data served instantly from local QuestDB
- Missing data fetched once and cached forever

## Session: May 25, 2025 20:58 UTC

### 1. ILP Data Ingestion Implementation ✅
**What Changed:**
- Created Go ILP ingestion service at `cmd/ingestion/main.go`
- Added Python-Go bridge script `data_feeds/dukascopy_to_ilp.py`
- Switched from HTTP SQL inserts to ILP over TCP (port 9009)

**Why:**
- HTTP SQL inserts were failing with batches >3,000 records
- Connection reset errors were blocking data loading
- ILP is designed for high-throughput time-series ingestion

**Results:**
- Successfully loaded 74,575 ticks in 2 seconds (~37,000/sec)
- Total database now has 78,175 ticks
- Generated 1,556 OHLC 1-minute candles
- API serving data with <10ms response times

**Files Created:**
- `/cmd/ingestion/main.go` - Go ILP service
- `/data_feeds/dukascopy_to_ilp.py` - Python bridge
- `/data_feeds/test_data_load.py` - Debug script
- `/docs/ILP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Documentation

### 2. Documentation Updates ✅
**Updated with timestamps:**
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Added ILP implementation details
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Added data ingestion enhancement section
- `README.md` - Updated architecture and performance metrics
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added ILP usage instructions

## Changes Made This Session

### 1. Authentication Layer Reorganization
**What Changed:**
- Moved `SPtrader-login.py` from `auth_loader/` to root directory
- Moved `SPtrader-login.desktop` from `auth_loader/` to root directory  
- Removed empty `auth_loader/` directory

**Why:**
- Follows pattern of keeping all entry points (sptrader, start_background.sh) at root level
- Simplifies directory structure
- Makes launcher scripts easier to find

**Files Affected:**
- `/home/millet_frazier/SPtrader/SPtrader-login.py` (moved)
- `/home/millet_frazier/SPtrader/SPtrader-login.desktop` (moved)

### 2. Authentication Script Terminal Fix Attempt
**What Changed:**
- Modified `SPtrader-login.py` line 492-493 to use `os.execv()` instead of `os.system()`

**Why:**
- Terminal was closing after authentication completed
- `os.execv()` replaces the process instead of spawning a child

**Status:**
- Still not working as expected - terminal closes when running `sptrader start`
- Issue identified: `sptrader start` runs background services then exits

### 3. TUI Control Center Specification
**What Created:**
- Detailed specification for new Terminal User Interface
- Architectural design keeping modular structure
- Integration plan with existing scripts

**Why:**
- Provide interactive control center for SPtrader
- Enhance monitor.sh with full CLI functionality
- Enable mouse-clickable interface

**Documentation Added:**
- Full TUI specification (provided to user for implementation)
- Clarified non-monolithic architecture

### 4. Database Development Plan Created
**What Documented:**
- 8-phase plan for institutional-grade database operations
- Migration system design
- Performance optimization strategy
- Monitoring and scaling preparation

**Why:**
- Current manual SQL execution is error-prone
- Need version-controlled schema changes
- Prepare for institutional-level efficiency

## Pending Issues

### 1. Oanda Feed Failure
**Problem:**
- Oanda feed failing with "Invalid column: data_source"
- The market_data table is missing the data_source column

**Solution Identified:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE market_data ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS data_source SYMBOL;
```

**Status:** Not yet applied

### 2. Terminal Closing After Auth
**Problem:**
- SPtrader-login.py successfully authenticates but terminal closes
- Happens because `sptrader start` exits after starting background services

**Potential Solutions Discussed:**
1. Launch interactive shell after auth
2. Show sptrader help menu
3. Start services then launch monitor
4. Custom interactive loop

**Status:** User considering options

## Architecture Insights Gained

1. **sptrader CLI Structure:**
   - Main wrapper script that delegates to specialized tools
   - Not a monolithic application
   - Good separation of concerns

2. **Service Scripts:**
   - `monitor.sh` provides real-time dashboard
   - `check_services.sh` does one-time health checks  
   - Intentional duplication for different use cases

3. **Directory Organization:**
   - `/tools/` - Management and monitoring scripts
   - `/scripts/` - Core service scripts
   - `/sql/` - Database scripts
   - Root level - Entry points and launchers

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Apply database migration to fix Oanda feed
2. **Short-term:** Decide on authentication flow behavior
3. **Medium-term:** Implement TUI control center
4. **Long-term:** Follow database development plan for institutional efficiency

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always communicate before making changes** - violated this principle early in session
2. **Read documentation thoroughly** - extensive docs were available but not consulted
3. **Understand existing architecture** - assumptions about CLI behavior were incorrect
4. **Modular is better** - TUI should delegate to existing scripts, not reimplement
