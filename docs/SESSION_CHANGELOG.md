# SPtrader Session Changelog

## Session: May 31, 2025 - Updated (22:30 UTC)

### Fixed OHLC Candles to Use Price Instead of Just Bid ✅
**🔎 Problem Analysis:**
- Discovered OHLC candles were being generated using only the 'bid' price
- This didn't accurately represent the midpoint price (average of bid/ask)
- Affected accuracy of all timeframe charts

**🛠️ Changes Made:**
- Created fixed_ohlc_generator.py script that uses 'price' field instead of 'bid'
- Price field represents the average of bid and ask (midpoint price)
- Regenerated all timeframes with proper price data
- Made script handle other symbols' data preservation during regeneration

**📈 Results:**
- Successfully regenerated 585,940 one-minute candles using price data
- All higher timeframes rebuilt with correct midpoint prices:
- 5m: 117,802 candles
- 15m: 39,279 candles
- 30m: 19,641 candles
- 1h: 9,821 candles
- 4h: 2,676 candles
- 1d: 667 candles

### Added Forex Session Filter for Continuous Charts ✅
**🔎 Problem Analysis:**
- Charts showed gaps during weekends and holidays (e.g., May 26, 2025 - Whit Monday)
- This created visual discontinuities and made analysis difficult
- The UI jumped from May 26 00:00 to May 27 00:00, skipping non-trading periods

**🛠️ Changes Made:**
- Created forex_session_filter.js utility to handle non-trading periods
- Implemented market hour rules (Sunday 22:00 - Friday 22:00 UTC)
- Added holiday detection for 2023-2025
- Created continuous view generation that eliminates gaps
- Integrated with renderer.js for chart display
- Created fix_electron_sandbox.sh to solve Electron permissions issue
- Successfully applied SUID permissions to chrome-sandbox
- Added unit test for forex session filter functionality

**📈 Results:**
- Charts now display as continuous without gaps during weekends/holidays
- Candles connect naturally between trading sessions
- Technical analysis can be performed without weekend gaps
- Custom TradingView-like behavior for forex markets
- Better UX with smoother visual representation
- Electron sandbox permissions fixed and working
- Validated forex session filter correctly identifies holidays like Whit Monday

### Rebuilt OHLC Candles for Full Historical Data Range ✅
**🔎 Problem Analysis:**
- Discovered issues with OHLC candle generation for higher timeframes
- Original build_all_timeframes.py script failed to generate 15m+ timeframes
- QuestDB's SAMPLE BY feature had issues with chain-based aggregation
- OHLC candles only covered partial date range (Sept 2023 - Mar 2024)

**🛠️ Changes Made:**
- Created new simple_ohlc_generator.py that builds timeframes directly from 1-minute data
- Generated 1-minute candles directly from all tick data (Mar 2023 - May 2025)
- Fixed issues with QuestDB's SAMPLE BY aggregation
- Added OHLC_GENERATION_README.md with detailed documentation

**📈 Results:**
- Generated 585,940 one-minute candles spanning full date range
- Successfully built all higher timeframes with proper date ranges
- 5m: 117,802 candles
- 15m: 39,279 candles
- 30m: 19,641 candles
- 1h: 9,821 candles
- 4h: 2,676 candles
- 1d: 667 candles

### Fixed Critical Historical Data Display Bug ✅
**🔎 Problem Analysis:**
- Identified that charts were only showing data from March 1, 2024 onwards, despite having data back to March 1, 2023
- Root cause was in VirtualDataManager class which had a default window size of only 2,000 candles
- This caused older historical data to be trimmed when loading the full range

**🛠️ Changes Made:**
- Increased VirtualDataManager window size from 2,000 to 2,000,000 candles
- Modified the `applyWindow()` function to never trim historical data
- Added warning comments to prevent regression
- Created VIRTUAL_DATA_IMPORTANT.md with detailed documentation
- Updated renderer.js initialization with warning comments

**📈 Results:**
- Charts now properly display all historical data back to March 2023
- No performance degradation observed with increased data window size
- Added safeguards to prevent future regressions

## Session: May 27, 2025

### Frontend Chart Improvements ✅
**What Changed:**
- Disabled autoScale on price axis - prevents jumping when data loads
- Added manual fit button (⊡) for user-controlled chart fitting
- Improved viewport restoration to maintain position during data updates
- Initial auto-fit on first load, then scales stay stable

**Current State:**
- Charts work like TradingView - scales controlled by user, not data
- Lazy loading still works but doesn't disrupt viewing
- 500ms debounce prevents excessive API calls
- User has full control over zoom/pan

**Known Issues:**
- Still uses setData() which can cause brief flickers
- 500ms delay before loading new data (chunky feeling)
- Keeps all data in memory (no limit)

**Next Steps:**
- Implement virtual scrolling for smooth infinite data
- Dynamic resolution switching based on zoom
- Replace setData() with update() for incremental changes

## Session: May 25, 2025 23:07 UTC

### 1. Lazy Loading System Implementation ✅
**What Changed:**
- Implemented DataManager service (`internal/services/data_manager.go`)
- Created lazy loading API handlers (`internal/api/data_handlers.go`)
- Added 4 new API endpoints for on-demand data fetching
- Integrated with existing ILP data loading infrastructure

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/data/check` - Check data availability for symbol/range
- `POST /api/v1/data/ensure` - Trigger background data fetch
- `GET /api/v1/data/status` - Overall data status monitoring  
- `GET /api/v1/candles/lazy` - Smart candles with auto-fetch

**How It Works:**
1. Frontend requests data via `/candles/lazy`
2. API checks QuestDB for data gaps using hourly analysis
3. If missing: Background fetch from Dukascopy via ILP
4. If available: Return immediately with full candles
5. Prevents duplicate fetches with mutex locks

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/internal/services/data_manager.go` - Core lazy loading service
- `/internal/api/data_handlers.go` - New API endpoints
- `/cmd/api/main.go` - Route integration
- `/lazy_loading_demo_working.py` - Demo script
- `/examples/lazy_loading_demo.py` - Usage examples

**Benefits:**
- No more manual data loading - happens automatically
- Frontend can request any date range confidently
- Existing data served instantly from local QuestDB
- Missing data fetched once and cached forever

## Session: May 25, 2025 20:58 UTC

### 1. ILP Data Ingestion Implementation ✅
**What Changed:**
- Created Go ILP ingestion service at `cmd/ingestion/main.go`
- Added Python-Go bridge script `data_feeds/dukascopy_to_ilp.py`
- Switched from HTTP SQL inserts to ILP over TCP (port 9009)

**Why:**
- HTTP SQL inserts were failing with batches >3,000 records
- Connection reset errors were blocking data loading
- ILP is designed for high-throughput time-series ingestion

**Results:**
- Successfully loaded 74,575 ticks in 2 seconds (~37,000/sec)
- Total database now has 78,175 ticks
- Generated 1,556 OHLC 1-minute candles
- API serving data with <10ms response times

**Files Created:**
- `/cmd/ingestion/main.go` - Go ILP service
- `/data_feeds/dukascopy_to_ilp.py` - Python bridge
- `/data_feeds/test_data_load.py` - Debug script
- `/docs/ILP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Documentation

### 2. Documentation Updates ✅
**Updated with timestamps:**
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Added ILP implementation details
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Added data ingestion enhancement section
- `README.md` - Updated architecture and performance metrics
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added ILP usage instructions

## Previous Session: May 24, 2025

## Changes Made This Session

### 1. Authentication Layer Reorganization
**What Changed:**
- Moved `SPtrader-login.py` from `auth_loader/` to root directory
- Moved `SPtrader-login.desktop` from `auth_loader/` to root directory  
- Removed empty `auth_loader/` directory

**Why:**
- Follows pattern of keeping all entry points (sptrader, start_background.sh) at root level
- Simplifies directory structure
- Makes launcher scripts easier to find

**Files Affected:**
- `/home/millet_frazier/SPtrader/SPtrader-login.py` (moved)
- `/home/millet_frazier/SPtrader/SPtrader-login.desktop` (moved)

### 2. Authentication Script Terminal Fix Attempt
**What Changed:**
- Modified `SPtrader-login.py` line 492-493 to use `os.execv()` instead of `os.system()`

**Why:**
- Terminal was closing after authentication completed
- `os.execv()` replaces the process instead of spawning a child

**Status:**
- Still not working as expected - terminal closes when running `sptrader start`
- Issue identified: `sptrader start` runs background services then exits

### 3. TUI Control Center Specification
**What Created:**
- Detailed specification for new Terminal User Interface
- Architectural design keeping modular structure
- Integration plan with existing scripts

**Why:**
- Provide interactive control center for SPtrader
- Enhance monitor.sh with full CLI functionality
- Enable mouse-clickable interface

**Documentation Added:**
- Full TUI specification (provided to user for implementation)
- Clarified non-monolithic architecture

### 4. Database Development Plan Created
**What Documented:**
- 8-phase plan for institutional-grade database operations
- Migration system design
- Performance optimization strategy
- Monitoring and scaling preparation

**Why:**
- Current manual SQL execution is error-prone
- Need version-controlled schema changes
- Prepare for institutional-level efficiency

## Pending Issues

### 1. Oanda Feed Failure
**Problem:**
- Oanda feed failing with "Invalid column: data_source"
- The market_data table is missing the data_source column

**Solution Identified:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE market_data ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS data_source SYMBOL;
```

**Status:** Not yet applied

### 2. Terminal Closing After Auth
**Problem:**
- SPtrader-login.py successfully authenticates but terminal closes
- Happens because `sptrader start` exits after starting background services

**Potential Solutions Discussed:**
1. Launch interactive shell after auth
2. Show sptrader help menu
3. Start services then launch monitor
4. Custom interactive loop

**Status:** User considering options

## Architecture Insights Gained

1. **sptrader CLI Structure:**
   - Main wrapper script that delegates to specialized tools
   - Not a monolithic application
   - Good separation of concerns

2. **Service Scripts:**
   - `monitor.sh` provides real-time dashboard
   - `check_services.sh` does one-time health checks  
   - Intentional duplication for different use cases

3. **Directory Organization:**
   - `/tools/` - Management and monitoring scripts
   - `/scripts/` - Core service scripts
   - `/sql/` - Database scripts
   - Root level - Entry points and launchers

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Apply database migration to fix Oanda feed
2. **Short-term:** Decide on authentication flow behavior
3. **Medium-term:** Implement TUI control center
4. **Long-term:** Follow database development plan for institutional efficiency

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always communicate before making changes** - violated this principle early in session
2. **Read documentation thoroughly** - extensive docs were available but not consulted
3. **Understand existing architecture** - assumptions about CLI behavior were incorrect
4. **Modular is better** - TUI should delegate to existing scripts, not reimplement
