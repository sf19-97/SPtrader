# Python vs Go for Data Service - Comparison

## Your Go Approach Strengths ✅
1. **Type Safety** - Data contracts enforced at compile time
2. **Performance** - Faster request handling, better concurrency
3. **Clean Architecture** - Fresh start with lessons learned
4. **Memory Efficiency** - Better for high-volume streaming

## Enhancing Existing Python API 🐍

### Option 1: Optimize Current FastAPI

```python
# Enhanced main.py with profiling insights
from typing import Literal
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class DataContract:
    """Enforced limits based on profiling"""
    RESOLUTIONS = {
        "5m": {"max_hours": 24, "max_points": 288, "table": "ohlc_5m_v2"},
        "1h": {"max_hours": 168, "max_points": 168, "table": "ohlc_1h_v2"},
        "4h": {"max_hours": 720, "max_points": 180, "table": "ohlc_4h_viewport"},
        "1d": {"max_hours": 8760, "max_points": 365, "table": "ohlc_1d_viewport"}
    }
    
    @classmethod
    def select_optimal_resolution(cls, start: datetime, end: datetime) -> str:
        """Smart resolution selection"""
        hours = (end - start).total_seconds() / 3600
        
        if hours <= 24:
            return "5m"
        elif hours <= 168:
            return "1h"
        elif hours <= 720:
            return "4h"
        else:
            return "1d"

@app.get("/api/candles/smart")
async def get_candles_smart(
    symbol: str,
    start: datetime,
    end: datetime,
    resolution: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Viewport-aware endpoint that auto-selects resolution"""
    
    # Auto-select resolution if not provided
    if not resolution:
        resolution = DataContract.select_optimal_resolution(start, end)
    
    # Get table and limits
    config = DataContract.RESOLUTIONS[resolution]
    
    # Query from optimal table
    query = f"""
        SELECT timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume
        FROM {config['table']}
        WHERE symbol = $1 AND timestamp >= $2 AND timestamp <= $3
        ORDER BY timestamp
        LIMIT {config['max_points']}
    """
    
    async with db_pool.acquire() as conn:
        rows = await conn.fetch(query, symbol, start, end)
    
    return {
        "symbol": symbol,
        "resolution": resolution,
        "start": start,
        "end": end,
        "points": len(rows),
        "candles": [dict(row) for row in rows],
        "metadata": {
            "table_used": config['table'],
            "max_points": config['max_points'],
            "cache_key": generate_cache_key(symbol, resolution, start, end)
        }
    }
```

### Option 2: Hybrid - Go Sidecar Service

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  questdb:
    image: questdb/questdb
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
      - "8812:8812"
  
  api-python:
    build: ./api
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DATA_SERVICE_URL=http://data-service:3000
  
  data-service-go:
    build: ./data-service-go
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - QUESTDB_URL=postgresql://questdb:8812/qdb
```

Python API delegates heavy queries to Go:
```python
# In FastAPI
async def get_viewport_data(symbol: str, start: datetime, end: datetime):
    """Delegate to Go service for heavy lifting"""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(
            "http://data-service:3000/viewport",
            params={"symbol": symbol, "start": start, "end": end}
        )
    return response.json()
```

## Recommendation 🎯

**Start with Enhanced Python**, then add Go if needed:

1. **Run the profiler** first
2. **Implement smart resolution** in Python
3. **Measure performance** with real data
4. **If Python is fast enough** (likely <100ms for viewport queries), stick with it
5. **If you need more speed**, add Go service for data-heavy endpoints

The key insight remains: **Profile first, build UI to match data capabilities!**

## Performance Comparison (Expected)

| Metric | Python + asyncpg | Go + pgx |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Simple query (<500 points) | ~50ms | ~20ms |
| Large query (5000 points) | ~200ms | ~80ms |
| Concurrent requests | Good (100+) | Excellent (1000+) |
| Memory usage | Higher | Lower |
| Development speed | Faster | Slower |
| Type safety | Runtime | Compile-time |

## The Sweet Spot

For SPtrader, enhanced Python is probably sufficient because:
- Viewport tables keep queries small
- Caching reduces repeated queries  
- asyncpg is already pretty fast
- You avoid polyglot complexity

But your Go approach is solid engineering if you need maximum performance!
